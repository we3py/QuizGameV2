I know what azure portal is;It’s portal to azure ecosystem, using Custom Interface as a communication layer;It’s a hub to maintain my azure cloud infrastructure.;It’s a hub to maintain my build tasks environment.;It’s team integration hub;A
Ci is abbreviation of:;Common Interface;Continuous integration ;Cloud Integration;Cat Intelligence;B
CD is abbreviation of:;Common Domain;Continuous Degenerate;Continous Delivery;Common Driver;C
I can explain the purpose of CI;CI is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.;CI is a version repository used to maintain project. It’s  distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. ;CI is a cloud computing service operated by Microsoft for application management via Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and supports many different programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.;CI is used to automate (continously integrate) code. It’s done by continously building, testing and performing other tasks during each pushed commits. Developers are notified when their branch is in failed state using mail or chat.;D
I know what pipeline is;It is a line of pipe with pumps, valves, and control devices for conveying liquids, gases, or finely divided solids;A pipeline is a process that drives software development through a path of building, testing, and deploying code, also known as CI/CD. By automating the process, the objective is to minimize human error and maintain a consistent process for how software is released. Tools that are included in the pipeline could include compiling code, unit tests, code analysis, security, and binaries creation. For containerized environments, this pipeline would also include packaging the code into a container image to be deployed across a hybrid cloud.;"Pipelines ensure that data preparation, such as normalization, is restricted to each fold of your cross-validation operation, minimizing data leaks in your test harness.

This critical data preparation and model evaluation method is demonstrated in the example below. There are two steps in the pipeline:

    Ensure that the data is uniform.
    Understand how to use a Linear Discriminant Analysis model.";Pipeline is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.;B
What is yaml?;Yaml is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.;Yaml is the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored;Yaml objects are most commonly used by the Services layer in an N-Tier application to transfer data between itself and the UI layer. The main benefit here is that it reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent across the wire in distributed applications. ;Yaml is a small object that represents a simple entity whose equality is not based on identity: i.e. two value objects are equal when they have the same value;A
Advantages of observer pattern:;Reduce unneeded code, Creates abstract layer between client and implementation.;Help us close responsibility in one place, creating more cohesive code;Decauple code, making it Open/Close friendly. Let’s us react to events, which are not easily preddictable (eg. User input, Mail arrival);Prevents other objects from instantiating their own copies of the object, ensuring that all objects access the single instance. Since the class controls the instantiation process, the class has the flexibility to change the instantiation process.;C
Event is:;"An event is an action which you can respond to, or ""handle,"" in code. Events can be generated by a user action, such as clicking the mouse or pressing a key; by program code; or by the system.";Event is something you go once a year to end up drunk in some ditch.;Event is an agreement between a buyer and a seller to exchange goods, services or financial instruments .;;A
Event Handler is:;An event handler is a method that is bound to an event. When the event is raised, the code within the event handler is executed. ;Event handler is used by the winforms to store user events in memory;Event handler is manager service used to move events to destination (component). For example mouse event will be moved to screen component.;Event Handler is a lambda used to post event to the Event Queue. It’s executed by the user.;A
Delegate is:;Delegates are classes commonly used within the .NET Framework to build event-handling mechanisms. Delegates roughly equate to function pointers. Unlike function pointers however, delegates are object-oriented, type-safe, and secure. Event model uses delegates to bind events to the methods that are used to handle them.;Delegate is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. ;Delegate is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.;;A
Multicast delegate is:;A Multicast Delegate in C# is a delegate that is a product of multiple delegates coming together to form a aggregated object. hen we invoke the multicast delegate, then delegates will be invoket until there will be delegate that will be satisfied.;A Multicast Delegate in C# is a delegate that holds the references of more than one function. When we invoke the multicast delegate, then all the functions which are referenced by the delegate are going to be invoked. If you want to call multiple methods using a delegate then all the method signatures should be the same.;A Multicast Delegate in C# is a delegate that uses inhertance to be casted onto multiple types at the same time. By using polymorphism, it enables us to handle multiple event at the same time.;;B
Partial class is:;Partial class is a type of class, which is not instantiated but preserves basic static functionality.;Partial class  is a composite data type declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables under one name in a block of memory, allowing the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer or by the struct declared name which returns the same address. ;Partial class is a class that can be defined in multiple source files, but is essentialy single class. Our partial class can be assembled from multiple sources, like a pizza. We define partial class by providing keyword partial before class.;;C
Winforms is:;Windows Forms is a UI framework for building Windows desktop apps. It provides one of the most productive ways to create desktop apps based on the visual designer provided in Visual Studio. Functionality such as drag-and-drop placement of visual controls makes it easy to build desktop apps.;Windows Forms is a framework library to handle user forms in UI. Form can have multiple inputs, representing user information to be posted back to the server using Accept button. ;WinForms is an object-relational mapper that enables .NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.;WinForms is a toolkit that supports the development of 2D structured graphics programs, in general, and Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs), in particular. A ZUI is a new kind of interface that presents a huge canvas of information on a traditional computer display by letting the user smoothly zoom in, to get more detailed information, and zoom out for an overview. ;A
Databinding in winforms is:;Data binding provides access to versions of SQL Server, which encapsulates database-specific protocols. The functionality of the data provider is designed to be similar to that of the .NET Framework data providers for OLE DB, ODBC, and Oracle. System.Data.SqlClient includes a tabular data stream (TDS) parser to communicate directly with SQL Server. ;Data binding provides APIs that allow your components to dispatch actions and subscribe to data updates from the store.;Data binding refers to embedding expressions into marked up text. By default, interpolation uses the double curly braces {{ and }} as delimiters.;Data binding is the process that establishes a connection between the app UI and the data it displays. If the binding has the correct settings and the data provides the proper notifications, when the data changes its value, the elements that are bound to the data reflect changes automatically.;D
